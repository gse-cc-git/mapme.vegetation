Description: This package allows an easy access to Sentinel-2 Level 2A data
     from the freely available Amazon AWS bucket and subsequent processing based on the 
     the datacube framework provided by gdalcubes. A total number of 206 vegetation 
     indices as well as the surface reflectance values can be calculated for a 
     regular time series. It supports the extraction of zonal statistcs for polygons to be 
     directly used in project evaluation or subsequent modelling tasks. 
     The package is part of the MAPME toolset at <https://github.com/mapme-initiative> 
     and was developed by MapTailor Geospatial Consulting <https://maptailor.net/>.
